# How We Protect Your Information
We place a high priority on the security of your information. We use secure socket layer technology to encrypt the transmission of sensitive data you input as part of our service, such as a credit card number (SSL). Your credit card information and other sensitive data are not kept on our servers. To provide safe and secure payment methods for any transaction, we employ the services of a secure payment gateway. Our website never transmits your credit card information because the payment gateway is in charge of gathering, storing, and encrypting your information.

Once we receive your personal information, TagHub uses commercially reasonable physical, administrative, and technical precautions to maintain its security and integrity. For instance, we frequently and continuously back up your data to assist in data recovery and prevent data loss. In order to safeguard our network and better protect your information, we also take precautions against typical web attack vectors and set up firewalls and access controls on our servers. However, since there is no 100% secure means of electronic transmission or storage, we are unable to guarantee or promise the security of any information you communicate or store using the Service.

According to the notification procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy or as otherwise required by applicable law, TagHub will promptly notify those individuals whose personal information has been compromised in the event that personal information is compromised as a result of a security breach.
